# Amazon-Homepage-Clone

Project Overview: Creating a website clone is an ambitious endeavor, and I chose Amazon - one of the largest online marketplaces globally -as my inspiration .The goal was to replicate Amazon's user interface and key features.Here's what I accomplished--
Static Website : I developed a static website using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.

Design Elements: The project mimics Amazon Amazon's layout,including a navigation bar, search box, product cards, and footer.

Visual Appeal: I used external libraries like Font Awesome for icons and Google Fonts to enhance the overall  design.

 Responsive: The site adapts seamlessly to different laptop/PC screen sizes.
